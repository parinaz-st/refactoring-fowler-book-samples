## About This Repository

This repository is originally based on code by **Naofumi Kagami** and can be found [here](https://github.com/naofumi/refactoring)  
The goal of this version is to refactor and improve the code while practicing the techniques described in the **second edition of _Refactoring_ by Martin Fowler**.

# Summary

This repository provides executable code of the examples provided in
"Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" by Martin Fowler, et. al.

The folders inside `src/main/java/com/example` are named by page number in the book, and the name of the refactoring technique being introduced. Inside each folder, you can find some Java classes. To test any of the examples, you can execute any of the classes that contain a `main` method. 

I fully understand that testing is an integral part of refactoring. It is therefore highly unfortunately that I have not been able to provide automated tests for each example in this book. The good news is that I am in the process of writing JUnit tests and hopefully we will soon be able to have this for all examples.

Note that the code herein represent the examples before refactoring. The reader is expected to use this code as a starting point on which to apply the proceedures in the book.

# Learning Refactoring

1. Run the code as is to get and idea of how it works.
2. Refactor according to the book.
3. Re-run the code to see if it works.

I also strongly recommend that, in addition to refactoring the code, you should read the "Motivation" paragraphs. These short sections are succinct, but are full of valuable information. It's worth trying to understand each sentence and each phrase. Nothing should be glossed over. There's a lot of wisdom in every single word.
